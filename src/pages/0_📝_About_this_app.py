This Streamlit app is a demo that applies OpenAI's ChatGPT to provide math conversation and problem-solving hints to students.

The core technical approach is to use ["retrieval augmented generation"](https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/rag) to improve the relevance of the responses to middle-school math students.
