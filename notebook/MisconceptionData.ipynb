decimal point. \\n\\nMaE9: The incorrect answer shows a MaE of when students identify a common denominator but fail to change the fractions into equivalent form, as it does not correctly convert the fractions to equivalent form.\\n\\nMaE31: The incorrect answer shows a MaE of when students make the sum of two negatives a positive in an equation with variables, as it subtracts 7 from -9 instead of correctly subtracting -9 from 7.\\n\\nMaE10: The incorrect answer shows a MaE of when students incorrectly regroup when subtracting mixed numbers, as it subtracts the smaller number from the larger instead of correctly regrouping and subtracting.\\n\\nMaE39: The incorrect answer shows a MaE of when students don\\'t understand that a linear function represents a rate of change or they don\\'t connect linearity and proportionality, as it does not correctly identify the linear relationship and its implications.\\n\\nMaE21: The incorrect answer shows a MaE of when students usually don\\'t regroup when subtracting, but instead they take the smaller number minus the larger, as it subtracts one number from the other in the wrong order.\\n\\nMaE7: The incorrect answer shows a MaE of when students simplify the numerator but not the denominator, as it simplifies one part of the fraction but not the other.\\n\\nMaE36: The incorrect answer shows a MaE of when students show difficulty depicting key aspects and relationships in patterns, as it does not accurately represent the problem using graphic notation.\\n\\nMaE2: The incorrect answer shows a MaE of when students show a misunderstanding of the connections among proportional relationships part/whole, part/part, whole/part, as it does not correctly interpret the ratios and uses subtraction instead.\\n\\nMaE27: The incorrect answer shows a MaE of when students perform an incorrect interpretation of the exponential expression, as it does not correctly interpret the meaning of the exponent.\\n\\nMaE56: The incorrect answer shows a MaE of when students combine (or not combine) like terms, as it does not correctly combine the like terms in the expression.\\n\\nMaE49: The incorrect answer shows a MaE of when students believe that variables can only represent varying quantities rather than expressions, as it does not correctly use the variables to represent the same value.\\n\\nMaE40: The incorrect answer shows a MaE of when students don\\'t understand that a linear function represents a rate of change or they don\\'t connect linearity and proportionality, as it does not correctly identify the linear relationship and its implications.\\n\\nMaE17: The incorrect answer shows a MaE of when students perform an incorrect interpretation of the exponential expression, as it incorrectly changes the whole number into a fraction.']"
