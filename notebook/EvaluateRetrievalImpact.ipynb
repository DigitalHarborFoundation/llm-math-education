      "Convert Fractions to Decimals: In Decimals, we learned to convert decimals to fractions. Now we will do the reverse—convert fractions to decimals. Remember that the fraction bar indicates division. So 45 can be written 4÷5 or 54. This means that we can convert a fraction to a decimal by treating it as a division problem.Repeating Decimals: So far, in all the examples converting fractions to decimals the division resulted in a remainder of zero. This is not always the case. Let’s see what happens when we convert the fraction 43 to a decimal. First, notice that 43 is an improper fraction. Its value is greater than 1. The equivalent decimal will also be greater than 1.  We divide 4 by 3.  No matter how many more zeros we write, there will always be a remainder of 1, and the threes in the quotient will go on forever. The number 1.333… is called a repeating decimal. Remember that the “…” means that the pattern repeats.  How do you know how many ‘repeats’ to write? Instead of writing 1.333… we use a shorthand notation by placing a line over the digits that repeat. The repeating decimal 1.333… is written 1.3–. The line above the 3 tells you that the 3 repeats endlessly. So 1.333…=1.3– For other decimals, two or more digits might repeat. Table 5.5 shows some more examples of repeating decimals.  It is useful to convert between fractions and decimals when we need to add or subtract numbers in different forms. To add a fraction and a decimal, for example, we would need to either convert the fraction to a decimal or the decimal to a fraction.\n",
      "Order Decimals and Fractions: In Decimals, we compared two decimals and determined which was larger. To compare a decimal to a fraction, we will first convert the fraction to a decimal and then compare the decimals.  When ordering negative numbers, remember that larger numbers are to the right on the number line and any positive number is greater than any negative number.\n",
      "Simplify Expressions Using the Order of Operations: The order of operations introduced in Use the Language of Algebra also applies to decimals. Do you remember what the phrase “Please excuse my dear Aunt Sally” stands for?\n",
      "Find the Circumference and Area of Circles: The properties of circles have been studied for over 2,000 years. All circles have exactly the same shape, but their sizes are affected by the length of the radius, a line segment from the center to any point on the circle. A line segment that passes through a circle’s center connecting two points on the circle is called a diameter. The diameter is twice as long as the radius. See Figure 5.6. The size of a circle can be measured in two ways. The distance around a circle is called its circumference.  Archimedes discovered that for circles of all different sizes, dividing the circumference by the diameter always gives the same number. The value of this number is pi, symbolized by Greek letter π (pronounced pie). However, the exact value of π cannot be calculated since the decimal never ends or repeats (we will learn more about numbers like this in The Properties of Real Numbers.) If we want the exact circumference or area of a circle, we leave the symbol π in the answer. We can get an approximate answer by substituting 3.14 as the value of π. We use the symbol ≈ to show that the result is approximate, not exact.  Since the diameter is twice the radius, another way to find the circumference is to use the formula C=πd.  Suppose we want to find the exact area of a circle of radius 10 inches. To calculate the area, we would evaluate the formula for the area when r=10 inches and leave the answer in terms of π.  We write π after the 100. So the exact value of the area is A=100π square inches.  To approximate the area, we would substitute π≈3.14.  Remember to use square units, such as square inches, when you calculate the area.Approximate π with a Fraction: Convert the fraction 227 to a decimal. If you use your calculator, the decimal number will fill up the display and show 3.14285714. But if we round that number to two decimal places, we get 3.14, the decimal approximation of π. When we have a circle with radius given as a fraction, we can substitute 227 for π instead of 3.14. And, since 227 is also an approximation of π, we will use the ≈ symbol to show we have an approximate value.\n",

      "Use the Commutative and Associative Properties: Think about adding two numbers, such as 5 and 3.  The results are the same. 5+3=3+5  Notice, the order in which we add does not matter. The same is true when multiplying 5 and 3.  Again, the results are the same! 5·3=3·5. The order in which we multiply does not matter.  These examples illustrate the commutative properties of addition and multiplication.  The commutative properties have to do with order. If you change the order of the numbers when adding or multiplying, the result is the same.  What about subtraction? Does order matter when we subtract numbers? Does 7−3 give the same result as 3−7?  Since changing the order of the subtraction did not give the same result, we can say that subtraction is not commutative.  Let’s see what happens when we divide two numbers. Is division commutative?  Since changing the order of the division did not give the same result, division is not commutative.  Addition and multiplication are commutative. Subtraction and division are not commutative. Suppose you were asked to simplify this expression.  How would you do it and what would your answer be?  Some people would think 7+8is15 and then 15+2is17. Others might start with 8+2makes10 and then 7+10makes17.  Both ways give the same result, as shown in Figure 7.3. (Remember that parentheses are grouping symbols that indicate which operations should be done first.)  When adding three numbers, changing the grouping of the numbers does not change the result. This is known as the Associative Property of Addition. The same principle holds true for multiplication as well. Suppose we want to find the value of the following expression:  Changing the grouping of the numbers gives the same result, as shown in Figure 7.4.  When multiplying three numbers, changing the grouping of the numbers does not change the result. This is known as the Associative Property of Multiplication. If we multiply three numbers, changing the grouping does not affect the product. You probably know this, but the terminology may be new to you. These examples illustrate the Associative Properties.  Besides using the associative properties to make calculations easier, we will often use it to simplify expressions with variables.\n",
      "Evaluate Expressions using the Commutative and Associative Properties: The commutative and associative properties can make it easier to evaluate some algebraic expressions. Since order does not matter when adding or multiplying three or more terms, we can rearrange and re-group terms to make our work easier, as the next several examples illustrate.  Let’s do one more, this time with multiplication.\n",
      "Simplify Expressions Using the Commutative and Associative Properties: When we have to simplify algebraic expressions, we can often make the work easier by applying the Commutative or Associative Property first instead of automatically following the order of operations. Notice that in Example 7.8 part ⓑ was easier to simplify than part ⓐ because the opposites were next to each other and their sum is 0. Likewise, part ⓑ in Example 7.9 was easier, with the reciprocals grouped together, because their product is 1. In the next few examples, we’ll use our number sense to look for ways to apply these properties to make our work easier.  Now we will see how recognizing reciprocals is helpful. Before multiplying left to right, look for reciprocals—their product is 1.  In expressions where we need to add or subtract three or more fractions, combine those with a common denominator first.  When adding and subtracting three or more terms involving decimals, look for terms that combine to give whole numbers.  No matter what you are doing, it is always a good idea to think ahead. When simplifying an expression, think about what your steps will be. The next example will show you how using the Associative Property of Multiplication can make your work easier if you plan ahead.  When simplifying expressions that contain variables, we can use the commutative and associative properties to re-order or regroup terms, as shown in the next pair of examples.  In The Language of Algebra, we learned to combine like terms by rearranging an expression so the like terms were together. We simplified the expression 3x+7+4x+5 by rewriting it as 3x+4x+7+5 and then simplified it to 7x+12. We were using the Commutative Property of Addition.\n",

      "Find the Least Common Denominator: In the previous section, we explained how to add and subtract fractions with a common denominator. But how can we add and subtract fractions with unlike denominators?  Let’s think about coins again. Can you add one quarter and one dime? You could say there are two coins, but that’s not very useful. To find the total value of one quarter plus one dime, you change them to the same kind of unit—cents. One quarter equals 25 cents and one dime equals 10 cents, so the sum is 35 cents. See Figure 4.7.  Similarly, when we add fractions with different denominators we have to convert them to equivalent fractions with a common denominator. With the coins, when we convert to cents, the denominator is 100. Since there are 100 cents in one dollar, 25 cents is 25100 and 10 cents is 10100. So we add 25100+10100 to get 35100, which is 35 cents.  You have practiced adding and subtracting fractions with common denominators. Now let’s see what you need to do with fractions that have different denominators.  First, we will use fraction tiles to model finding the common denominator of 12 and 13.  We’ll start with one 12 tile and 13 tile. We want to find a common fraction tile that we can use to match both 12 and 13 exactly.  If we try the 14 pieces, 2 of them exactly match the 12 piece, but they do not exactly match the 13 piece.  If we try the 15 pieces, they do not exactly cover the 12 piece or the 13 piece.  If we try the 16 pieces, we see that exactly 3 of them cover the 12 piece, and exactly 2 of them cover the 13 piece.  If we were to try the 112 pieces, they would also work.  Even smaller tiles, such as 124 and 148, would also exactly cover the 12 piece and the 13 piece.  The denominator of the largest piece that covers both fractions is the least common denominator (LCD) of the two fractions. So, the least common denominator of 12 and 13 is 6. Notice that all of the tiles that cover 12 and 13 have something in common: Their denominators are common multiples of 2 and 3, the denominators of 12 and 13. The least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators is 6, and so we say that 6 is the least common denominator (LCD) of the fractions 12 and 13. To find the LCD of two fractions, we will find the LCM of their denominators. We follow the procedure we used earlier to find the LCM of two numbers. We only use the denominators of the fractions, not the numerators, when finding the LCD.  To find the LCD of two fractions, find the LCM of their denominators. Notice how the steps shown below are similar to the steps we took to find the LCM.\n",
      "Convert Fractions to Equivalent Fractions with the LCD: Earlier, we used fraction tiles to see that the LCD of 14 when 16 is 12. We saw that three 112 pieces exactly covered 14 and two 112 pieces exactly covered 16, so   We say that 14 and 312 are equivalent fractions and also that 16 and 212 are equivalent fractions.  We can use the Equivalent Fractions Property to algebraically change a fraction to an equivalent one. Remember, two fractions are equivalent if they have the same value. The Equivalent Fractions Property is repeated below for reference.  To add or subtract fractions with different denominators, we will first have to convert each fraction to an equivalent fraction with the LCD. Let’s see how to change 14 and 16 to equivalent fractions with denominator 12 without using models.\n",
      "Add and Subtract Fractions with Different Denominators: Once we have converted two fractions to equivalent forms with common denominators, we can add or subtract them by adding or subtracting the numerators.  When we use the Equivalent Fractions Property, there is a quick way to find the number you need to multiply by to get the LCD. Write the factors of the denominators and the LCD just as you did to find the LCD. The “missing” factors of each denominator are the numbers you need.  The LCD, 36, has 2 factors of 2 and 2 factors of 3.  Twelve has two factors of 2, but only one of 3—so it is ‘missing‘ one 3. We multiplied the numerator and denominator of 712 by 3 to get an equivalent fraction with denominator 36.  Eighteen is missing one factor of 2—so you multiply the numerator and denominator 518 by 2 to get an equivalent fraction with denominator 36. We will apply this method as we subtract the fractions in the next example.  In the next example, one of the fractions has a variable in its numerator. We follow the same steps as when both numerators are numbers.\n",

      "Find the Least Common Denominator: In the previous section, we explained how to add and subtract fractions with a common denominator. But how can we add and subtract fractions with unlike denominators?  Let’s think about coins again. Can you add one quarter and one dime? You could say there are two coins, but that’s not very useful. To find the total value of one quarter plus one dime, you change them to the same kind of unit—cents. One quarter equals 25 cents and one dime equals 10 cents, so the sum is 35 cents. See Figure 4.7.  Similarly, when we add fractions with different denominators we have to convert them to equivalent fractions with a common denominator. With the coins, when we convert to cents, the denominator is 100. Since there are 100 cents in one dollar, 25 cents is 25100 and 10 cents is 10100. So we add 25100+10100 to get 35100, which is 35 cents.  You have practiced adding and subtracting fractions with common denominators. Now let’s see what you need to do with fractions that have different denominators.  First, we will use fraction tiles to model finding the common denominator of 12 and 13.  We’ll start with one 12 tile and 13 tile. We want to find a common fraction tile that we can use to match both 12 and 13 exactly.  If we try the 14 pieces, 2 of them exactly match the 12 piece, but they do not exactly match the 13 piece.  If we try the 15 pieces, they do not exactly cover the 12 piece or the 13 piece.  If we try the 16 pieces, we see that exactly 3 of them cover the 12 piece, and exactly 2 of them cover the 13 piece.  If we were to try the 112 pieces, they would also work.  Even smaller tiles, such as 124 and 148, would also exactly cover the 12 piece and the 13 piece.  The denominator of the largest piece that covers both fractions is the least common denominator (LCD) of the two fractions. So, the least common denominator of 12 and 13 is 6. Notice that all of the tiles that cover 12 and 13 have something in common: Their denominators are common multiples of 2 and 3, the denominators of 12 and 13. The least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators is 6, and so we say that 6 is the least common denominator (LCD) of the fractions 12 and 13. To find the LCD of two fractions, we will find the LCM of their denominators. We follow the procedure we used earlier to find the LCM of two numbers. We only use the denominators of the fractions, not the numerators, when finding the LCD.  To find the LCD of two fractions, find the LCM of their denominators. Notice how the steps shown below are similar to the steps we took to find the LCM.\n",
      "Convert Fractions to Equivalent Fractions with the LCD: Earlier, we used fraction tiles to see that the LCD of 14 when 16 is 12. We saw that three 112 pieces exactly covered 14 and two 112 pieces exactly covered 16, so   We say that 14 and 312 are equivalent fractions and also that 16 and 212 are equivalent fractions.  We can use the Equivalent Fractions Property to algebraically change a fraction to an equivalent one. Remember, two fractions are equivalent if they have the same value. The Equivalent Fractions Property is repeated below for reference.  To add or subtract fractions with different denominators, we will first have to convert each fraction to an equivalent fraction with the LCD. Let’s see how to change 14 and 16 to equivalent fractions with denominator 12 without using models.\n",
      "Add and Subtract Fractions with Different Denominators: Once we have converted two fractions to equivalent forms with common denominators, we can add or subtract them by adding or subtracting the numerators.  When we use the Equivalent Fractions Property, there is a quick way to find the number you need to multiply by to get the LCD. Write the factors of the denominators and the LCD just as you did to find the LCD. The “missing” factors of each denominator are the numbers you need.  The LCD, 36, has 2 factors of 2 and 2 factors of 3.  Twelve has two factors of 2, but only one of 3—so it is ‘missing‘ one 3. We multiplied the numerator and denominator of 712 by 3 to get an equivalent fraction with denominator 36.  Eighteen is missing one factor of 2—so you multiply the numerator and denominator 518 by 2 to get an equivalent fraction with denominator 36. We will apply this method as we subtract the fractions in the next example.  In the next example, one of the fractions has a variable in its numerator. We follow the same steps as when both numerators are numbers.\n",

      "When using PEMDAS with fractions, you follow the same order of operations. However, you may need to convert fractions to equivalent fractions with a common denominator before performing any operations. The common denominator helps ensure that the fractions have the same denominator, making it easier to add, subtract, multiply, or divide them.\n",

The LCM is the smallest multiple that two numbers have in common. Once you find the LCD, you convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with the LCD as the denominator.\n",

      "For example, let's say you have the fractions 1/2 and 1/3. The denominators are different, so we find the LCD. The LCM of 2 and 3 is 6. We convert 1/2 to an equivalent fraction with denominator 6 by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by 3: (1/2) x (3/3) = 3/6. Similarly, we convert 1/3 to an equivalent fraction with denominator 6 by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by 2: (1/3) x (2/2) = 2/6.\n",
