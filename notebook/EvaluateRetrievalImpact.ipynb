Square root is denoted by √. Note that square roots exist only for positive numbers.  Example: Find the square root of the given number Ques:  √196 Ans: 14 Hint: 14 multiplied by 14 gives the number 196.   It's time for you to pratice. Shall we get started?  Write yes to proceed.\n",
      "In today's lesson, we are going to learn to identify the factors of a given number.  A factor of a number is the number that divides it completely without leaving any remainder.  Example: To find the factors of 10,  write down all the multiplication sentences which gives 10 as the answer.   5x2 =10 1x10=10  Here the numbers 1,2,5 and 10 are the factors of the number 10. Also note that 1 and the number itself are factors of the number.  Ques: Which number is a factor of 6? A. 3 B. 5 C. 7 D. 9  Ans: A  Hint: We know that 2x3=6, hence 2 and 3 are factors of 6. Hence the answer is 3.  Shall we try some questions?😄    Type Yes to continue to solve some questions.  Yay! you are doing a great job. Let's solve some more questions. Write the missing factor.   Ques: 6x ____=54 Ans: 9  Write the missing factor.  Type Yes to continue to solve some questions.\n",

The only important things to know before you start multiplying is the signs. 1. Negative sign × Positive sign = Negative sign  2. Negative sign × Negative sign = Positive sign 3. Positive sign × Positive sign = Positive sign  Remember to place the correct sign in the answer.  Would you like to try some questions?  Multiply the numbers. Choose from the option A or B.
